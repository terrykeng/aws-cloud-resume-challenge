            <h3>Professional SUMMARY</h3>
            <p>
				Welcome to this section where you can delve deeper into my background, skills, projects, and achievements, allowing you to gain a comprehensive understanding of who I am. 

				I spent my formative years in Lagos, Nigeria, and I'm currently based in Regina, Canada. Reflecting on my journey, I am profoundly grateful for the path that has brought me thousands of miles from my homeland. This journey has been marked by hard work, challenges, and unwavering determination – qualities that I carry with pride. 
				
				Being the firstborn in my family, the responsibility to provide and lead fell upon me. This pushed me to mature swiftly, confronting realities at a young age. My education journey began uniquely, entering high school at the age of 9 in a boarding school far from home. Despite being the youngest and facing bullying, I persevered, understanding the importance of success for my family. 
				
		
				  
            </p>

            <p>
				In my second year, I discovered chess, a game that became my refuge. Through countless matches, losses, and victories, I honed my strategic thinking and resilience. Over time, I transformed from the bullied kid to the best junior chess player in my school. The journey continued with competitions and challenges, culminating in my triumph during my final year of high school. 
				
				These experiences showcased my determination to overcome odds and excel. They shaped me into a go-getter, someone who embraces challenges with full dedication. My journey isn't just about professional achievements; it's about personal growth and unwavering persistence.
				
				Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering marked my transition into the IT realm, a long-held dream of mine. My thirst for knowledge remains unquenched, propelling me forward in both my career and personal life.
				
				This narrative isn't merely about chess or high school struggles; it's a testament to my character – a blend of resilience, curiosity, and a passion for success. My professional journey, much like my life, is a story of pushing boundaries and striving for excellence.
				
				Thank you for taking the time to explore this chapter of my journey, where the unpolished aspects of my history intertwine with my drive for professional brilliance. The next sections include my academic acheivement, my skills, experience and achievements.
