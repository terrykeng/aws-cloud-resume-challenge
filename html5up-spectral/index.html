				MY BACKGROUND
            </h2>
            <p>
				I spent my formative years in Lagos, Nigeria, embarking on an educational journey that introduced me to the realities of life at a young age. It was during this time that I had my first encounter with the world of software development.
			</p>

			<p>
				My initial foray into software development occurred during my time in Grade 9. It was during a summer holiday that I delved into the foundational aspects of web development. This introductory period saw me immersing myself in the essentials of web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

            <h2>
             My Path of a software developer
            </h2>
			<p>
				Upon completing high school in 2018, I was resolute in my pursuit of a career as a software developer. This innate passion led me to enroll in a Bachelor's degree program in Computer Engineering, recognizing the essential role education would play in shaping my journey.
			</p>
				During the summer of 2019, while embarking on my first year in college, I embraced an opportunity for growth. I participated in an immersive, in-person training focused on Python programming. This marked the inception of my voyage in the realm of software development. It was in this environment that I was captivated by Python's versatility and its capacity to solve intricate challenges. The process of ideating innovative solutions, translating them into code, and meticulously debugging until the desired outcome was achieved, resonated deeply with me.

            <h2>
             My Evolution Story
            </h2>
            <p>
				I resumed my college studies in the subsequent semester after a brief hiatus. Unfortunately, the academic year was curtailed due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, necessitating the completion of the remaining academic calendar remotely. During this period, I remained proactive by engaging in self-guided learning endeavors, notably exploring C++ through YouTube tutorials. Recognizing its status as one of the earliest programming languages, I believed a firm grasp of C++ would further strengthen my foundational knowledge. This effort was particularly timely as I was preparing to instruct a C++ course at my school.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				As the academic year resumed in-person classes post the Covid-19 hiatus, I excelled in the C++ course and subsequently transitioned to studying C programming. The summer of 2021 marked a pivotal point as I enrolled in an intensive Cisco networking course. My intention was to comprehensively explore various IT domains, discerning my personal affinity. Over four months, I dedicated 20 hours per week to this program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Towards the end of 2021, I ventured into the realm of blockchain development. My initial involvement was in crafting landing pages for a cryptocurrency community called Choice Coin on the Algorand blockchain. My adeptness in web development, research, and software quality was evident, resulting in ascending the ranks within the development team. Collaborating with fellow college friends who shared web development skills underscored the importance of a robust network.
				
				By mid-2022, I had immersed myself fully in the world of blockchain development. I actively participated in multiple developer communities and diverse blockchain hackathons spanning Solana, Algorand, and Ethereum. A highlight was our team's achievement in an Algorand hackathon on May 16th, clinching first place. We conceptualized and developed a decentralized game on the Algorand blockchain, successfully integrating a secure smart contract and an engaging GUI hosted on Netlify.

			  <h2>
			   My Professional Career
			  </h2>
			  <p>
				In the early months of 2022, I embarked on an internship journey with IEFE International, a certified partner of Dell EMC. During my tenure, I was deeply immersed in the intricate dynamics of IT, garnering invaluable professional experience within a multinational IT corporation.

				My role as a Tech Support Intern afforded me the opportunity to actively manage on-premise servers and EMC storage devices, contributing significantly to the seamless flow of operations. Collaborating alongside seasoned professionals with extensive industry experience, I gained practical insights and skills. My involvement in EMC storage expanded my proficiency, particularly in working with Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network-Attached Storage (NAS) systems.

				This experience was pivotal in granting me an up-close understanding of dependable support services and an inside look at IT service delivery. Witnessing the synergy of teamwork and quality assurance within this environment stoked my enthusiasm for IT innovation and honed my abilities to tackle complex projects.

				Simultaneously, beyond my working hours, I devoted substantial time to participating in multiple blockchain hackathons and projects.

			  <h2>
			   How I met AWS
			  </h2>
			  <p>
				The culmination of my IEFE Internship was met with a senior colleague's engaging discourse on cloud computing and the progressive migration of company infrastructures to the cloud through Amazon Web Services (AWS).

				Intrigued by this revelation, I conducted further research and swiftly grasped the revolutionary potential of AWS. I recognized that AWS has revolutionized IT service delivery, rendering infrastructure management and security more streamlined and cost-effective than conventional on-premise approaches.

				With newfound determination, the subsequent month marked the inception of my AWS journey. Much like my approach to learning other programming languages, I began by enrolling in Stephen Marek's AWS Cloud Practitioner course on Udemy. This step was followed by delving into his Solutions Architect course. Through this journey, I cultivated a profound appreciation for crafting scalable and resilient microservices at an enterprise level.
